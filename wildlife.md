# What are wildlife sanctuaries

**A wildlife sanctuary is an area where animal habitats and their surroundings are protected from any sort of disturbance. The capturing, killing and poaching of animals is strictly prohibited in these regions.**

- Wildlife sanctuaries are established to protect the endangered species.

- It is quite difficult to always relocate the animals from their natural habitat, therefore, protecting them in their natural environment is advantageous.

- The endangered species are specially monitored in the wildlife sanctuaries. If they reproduce and grow in number while under protection, few specimens can be kept for breeding in the conservation parks for their survival.

- Biologist and researches can learn about the animals living there to better preserve them.

- A few sanctuaries take in injured and abandoned animals and rehabilitate them to health before releasing them in the forest.

- Wildlife sanctuaries preserve the endangered species and protect them from humans and predators.

### How to Protect Wildlife
