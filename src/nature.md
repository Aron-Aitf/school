## What is nature conservation

**Nature conservation is the care and protection of Earth’s natural resources for current and future generations.**

Earth’s natural resources include air, minerals, plants, soil, water, and wildlife.

Examples of nature conservation include:

- Restoring and maintaining habitats
- Maintaining species diversity and genes
- Maintaining ecosystems
- Preventing wasteful use of natural resources
- Maintaining environment functions
- Preventing deforestation
- Reducing overfishing

(These all contribute to mitigating climate change to various extents)

Nature conservation can take many forms:

- Gazetted protected areas, such as national parks
- Communal conservation efforts by indigenous peoples and local communities
- Conservation of private lands

## The difference between nature conservation and preservation

**While nature conservation and nature preservation are similar because the goal is to protect nature, the way of doing it differs.** Preservation means protecting nature from human use, while conservation seeks a sustainable use of nature by humans with activities like hunting, logging, or mining.

#### The Importance of nature conservation

Nature conservation is essential in protecting humans, animals, and plants as nature supports all life on Earth.

An ecosystem is a community of living things and their environment. How they work in harmony and affect each other and their environment is very important. If any part of an ecosystem is damaged or removed, it creates a ‘knock-on’ effect. Every natural ecosystem works in balance.

That is what nature conservation deals with: caring for and protecting the environment.

> “Nature conservation not only ensures the protection of our ecosystems and millions of species that depend on them, but also contributes to the prosperity of the millions of people (especially in developing countries) that depend on nature for their survival: food, water, and protection against extreme events.” -- Karen Gonzalez Downs(Biodiversity and Natural Climate Solution Expert)

While protected areas across the world have different names and rules, their essence is the same

There are three major reasons for nature conservation:

- For humankind’s survival: to repair some of the damage done by humans and maintain the environment for future generations.
- For biodiversity: to maintain species diversity for our benefit and that of wildlife.
- For heritage: to provide opportunities for education and the enjoyment of the environment.
  Nature conservation is crucial to keeping Earth habitable for humans.
