## What is nature conservation

**Nature conservation is the care and protection of Earth’s natural resources for current and future generations.**

Earth’s natural resources include air, minerals, plants, soil, water, and wildlife.

Examples of nature conservation include:

- Restoring and maintaining habitats
- Maintaining species diversity and genes
- Maintaining ecosystems
- Preventing wasteful use of natural resources
- Maintaining environment functions
- Preventing deforestation
- Reducing overfishing

(These all contribute to mitigating climate change to various extents)

Nature conservation can take many forms:

- Gazetted protected areas, such as national parks
- Communal conservation efforts by indigenous peoples and local communities
- Conservation of private lands

### The difference between nature conservation and preservation

**While nature conservation and nature preservation are similar because the goal is to protect nature, the way of doing it differs.** Preservation means protecting nature from human use, while conservation seeks a sustainable use of nature by humans with activities like hunting, logging, or mining.

### The Importance of nature conservation

Nature conservation is essential in protecting humans, animals, and plants as nature supports all life on Earth.

An ecosystem is a community of living things and their environment. How they work in harmony and affect each other and their environment is very important. If any part of an ecosystem is damaged or removed, it creates a ‘knock-on’ effect. Every natural ecosystem works in balance.

That is what nature conservation deals with: caring for and protecting the environment.

> “Nature conservation not only ensures the protection of our ecosystems and millions of species that depend on them, but also contributes to the prosperity of the millions of people (especially in developing countries) that depend on nature for their survival: food, water, and protection against extreme events.” -- Karen Gonzalez Downs(Biodiversity and Natural Climate Solution Expert)

While protected areas across the world have different names and rules, their essence is the same

There are three major reasons for nature conservation:

- For humankind’s survival: to repair some of the damage done by humans and maintain the environment for future generations.
- For biodiversity: to maintain species diversity for our benefit and that of wildlife.
- For heritage: to provide opportunities for education and the enjoyment of the environment.
  Nature conservation is crucial to keeping Earth habitable for humans.

## What are wildlife sanctuaries

**A wildlife sanctuary is an area where animal habitats and their surroundings are protected from any sort of disturbance. The capturing, killing and poaching of animals is strictly prohibited in these regions.**

- Wildlife sanctuaries are established to protect the endangered species.

- It is quite difficult to always relocate the animals from their natural habitat, therefore, protecting them in their natural environment is advantageous.

- The endangered species are specially monitored in the wildlife sanctuaries. If they reproduce and grow in number while under protection, few specimens can be kept for breeding in the conservation parks for their survival.

- Biologist and researches can learn about the animals living there to better preserve them.

- A few sanctuaries take in injured and abandoned animals and rehabilitate them to health before releasing them in the forest.

- Wildlife sanctuaries preserve the endangered species and protect them from humans and predators.

### How to Protect Wildlife

There are many things that people can do to help protect wildlife. Some of these include:

- Supporting organizations that work to protect wild animals and their habitats.
- Learning about the threats that different species face and taking steps to reduce our impact on their environment.
- Avoiding the purchase of products that were made using animal skins or other parts of endangered species.
- Refusing to participate in activities that involve the exploitation or mistreatment of wild animals, such as hunting, fishing, or trapping.
- Supporting organizations that work to protect and conserve wildlife habitats.

### Projects taken by the Indian government to Protect Vulnerable Species

- Project tiger
- Crocodile Breeding Project
- Lesser Cats Project
- The Manipur Brow-antlered Deer Project
- Project Elephant
- Project Rhino
- Himalayan musk deer Project
- Project Hangul

### Protection of Endangered Species

**The following actions have been made by the government to conserve the country's - threatened and endangered wild animal species**

- Under the terms of the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972, wild animals are legally protected from being hunted and exploited for commercial purposes.
- The Wild Life Protection Act of 1972 has been revised and strengthened. The Act's penalties for violations have been strengthened. The Act further stipulates that any tools, vehicles, or weapons used to commit wildlife offenses must be forfeited.
- Under the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, of 1972, Protected Areas, including National Parks, Sanctuaries, Conservation Reserves, and Community Reserves, covering significant wildlife habitats have been established throughout the nation to preserve wild animals.
- Under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of "Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats," "Project Tiger," and "Project Elephant," financial and technical support is given to the State/Union Territory Governments in order to improve wildlife protection and habitat.
- The Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972 gives the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) the authority to capture and prosecute wildlife criminals.
- It has been urged that the State/Union Territory Governments beef up their field formations and increase patrols in and around the Protected Areas.
- The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau was established to bolster the legal system's ability to combat poaching and the illegal trade in wildlife and its byproducts.

### Fun Facts

- India’s first national park was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park, now known as Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand.
- The largest Biosphere reserve in India is the Gulf of Kachchh, Gujarat, and the smallest Biosphere Reserve in India is Dibru-Saikhowa in Assam.
- There are now more than 1,600 wildlife sanctuaries and national parks around the world. In 1952, the Indian Wildlife Board was enacted to centralize all the rules and regulations applicable to wildlife conservation in India, which also remitted from state to state. In 1956, this Board passed a corner decree that accorded all Game Parks the status of a Sanctuary or a National Park. The Wildlife sanctuaries of India are classified as IUCN Category IV covered areas. As of February 2023, 567 wildlife sanctuaries were set up in India, covering 122,564.86 km2 or 3.73% of the country’s total land area.

### The difference between Endangered species and Extinct species

| Endangered species                                                                                                           | Extinct species                                                        |
